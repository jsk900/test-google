# test-google

Simple exercise to recreate as accurately as possible the old Google landing page.

The purpose of this exercise was to understand how to layout elements to resemble the original image (enclosed in the project). No A tags were used as the exercise was to recreate layout in a photographic way not a functional way. Also no responsiveness was taken into account.
